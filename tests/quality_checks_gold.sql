Script Purpose:
  This script performs quality checks to validate the integrity, consistency,
  and accuracy of the Gold layer. These checks ensure:

  - Referential integrity between fact and dimension tables.
  - Validation of relashiopnships in the data model for analytics purposes.

Usage Notes:
  - Run these checks after data loading silver layer.
  - Investigate and resolve any disrepancies found during checks.
